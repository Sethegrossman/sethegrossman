My number one passion is rock climbing. I began in the summer of 2018
and have spent as much of my time as possible either in the climbing gym, or more preferably outside in the mountains.

I also enjoy adventuring in many different forms. Some things I am proud of doing are:
* Going offroading in Moab
* Learning to snowboard in January of 2019
	* I can only do the easy greens
* Traveling to almost every major national park in the US
* Taking a two month long solo road trip around the US
* Learning to scuba dive
	* I've dove in the Florida Keys, Bon Aire, and soon Belize
* Traveling to Italy, France, and Monaco with my older brother
	* We saw a F1 race in Monte Carlo
* Attending the Indiapolis Auto Show for the past 9 years and counting
