Personal interests page will be available soon.

My number one passion is rock climbing. I began in the summer of 2018
and have spent as much of my time as possible either in the climbing gym, or more preferably outside in the mountains.

I also enjoy adventuring in whatever form that takes. Some things I am proud of doing are:
* Going offroading in Moab
* Learning to snowboard in January of 2019 (I can only do the easy routes)
* Traveling to almost every major national park in the US
* Taking a two month long solo road trip around the US
* Learning to scuba dive (I've dove in the Florida Keys, Bon Aire, and soon Belize)
* Traveling to Italy, France, and Monaco with my older brother (We saw the F1 race in Monte Carlo)
* Attending the Indiapolis Auto Show for the past 9 years and counting

Some other things I enjoy are:
* Listening to indie music (also old rock)
* Cooking (I don't have a specialty, I just like making new recepies)
* Beginner yoga classes
