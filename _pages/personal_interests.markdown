My number one passion is rock climbing. I began in the summer of 2018,
and since have spent as much time as possible either in the climbing gym, or more preferably in the mountains.

I also enjoy adventuring in many different forms. Some adventures I am proud to have taken are:
* Offroading in Moab
* Learning to snowboard in January of 2019
	* I can only do the easy greens
* Spending two months solo road tripping around the U.S.
	* I went to almost every major U.S. national park
* Learning to scuba dive
	* I've dove in the Florida Keys, Bon Aire, and soon Belize
* Traveling to Italy, France, and Monaco with my older brother
	* We saw a F1 race in Monte Carlo

Other things I enjoy are:
* Listening to folk music
* Cooking
	* I don't have a specialty, I just like making new recepies
* Beginner yoga classes
* Riding motorcycles
* Attending to auto shows
	* I've been to the Indiapolis Auto Show for the past 9 years and counting
